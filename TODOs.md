# TODOs

- combat improvements
  - Attack rolls (and initiative) should make noise
- initiative improvements
  - better roll messages
  - etc (make initiative a subclass of roll?)
- Token Hud improvements
  - better positioning
- sheet improvements
  - clean up spell memorization
    - make code pretty, move to methods on actor and item from actor-sheet.
    - alert when you can't memorize
- importer improvements
  - detect old-form save as and convert
  - strip newlines automatically (but smart like)
- fix all the places where localization was skipped
- new character sheets
- Support for quantity of missile weapons (like darts) on sheets
- Support for alternative initiative types
- Maybe verging too far into the land of excess automation:
  - ammo consumed by ranged attacks?
  - Calculate carry weight?
- add roll tables and text content from S&W
